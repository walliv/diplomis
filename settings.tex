%%% Thesis title
%  In the case of a very long thesis title, it may happen that it does not fit
%  into the slot in the footbar of the slides. You may use the command
%  \def\insertshorttitle{Shortened th.\ title}
%  where the shortened version of the title appears as the parameter.
%  If you do not want to shorten the title, you will have to redefine how the slide footbar
%  is generated, see: https://bit.ly/3EJTp5A
